            <p> <b>TOOTH COLORED FILLINGS</b>
            <br>
            1. Dental decay can produce adverse effects while eating, it can make chewing difficult and painful. Tooth color filling is also known as “composite fillings” is an ultimate solution for this. Moreover, it’s helpful in cavity treatment, restoring damaged teeth, and preventing teeth decay. It can be also beneficial in eliminating the area from where harmful bacteria can enter into the teeth. The fillings are also effective in restoring the functionality and aesthetics of teeth.
            <br>
            2.Tooth-colored fillings are made up of plastic resin & powdered glass. Krishna Aesthetic Center dentists will closely examine your teeth condition & will determine what is better for your teeth. We take care of your teeth and strive to preserve the integrity of your gums and teeth. Tooth Fillings are also known for their effectiveness to repair the broken and cracked teeth.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>TYPES OF FILLINGS</b>
            <br>
            There are different types of fillings that are used by dentists in order to treat cavity problems. Let’s go through these fillings.
            <br>
            a) <b> Composite Fillings -</b> These fillings are excellent for the front part of the tooth, where it matches with the color of the tooth & provides strong bonding. A composite resin filling is mainly a mix of two different types of material including – plastic and fine glass particles. As compared to the amalgam filling it’s much stronger.
            <br>
            b) <b>Gold Fillings -</b> These are much effective & extremely durable. As gold is an expensive material therefore gold fillings placement is costly. As compared to Composite filling, the gold filling doesn’t match with the color of the teeth. These are six to ten times costly than the amalgam filling.
            <br>
            c) <b>Amalgam Fillings -</b> As the name indicates, it’s the blend of the different kinds of materials including mercury and silver. And these also don’t match the color of your teeth. Amalgam fillings are quite stronger therefore stay for at least ten years.
            <br>
            d) <b>Ceramic Fillings -</b> The fillings are better known for providing the natural look as these match with teeth color. The cost of a ceramic filling is equivalent to or higher than gold fillings.
            <br>
            e) <b>Glass Ionomer -</b> These fillings are known due to their strength and made up of acrylic and fluoroaluminosilicate. These are used in excessive tooth decay condition, mostly when the decay has been extended below the gum. It’s also best for filling baby teeth.
            <br>

            <b>PROCEDURE  FOR TOOTH - COLORED FILLINGS</b>
            <br>
            At Krishna Aesthetic Center, we precisely offer painless & safe, tooth-colored fillings. First, our dentist will use the local anesthetic for providing numbness to the affected area. Now after this, to remove the decayed area advanced equipment is used. 
            An air abrasion instrument or laser can be used for this purpose depending on the location and extent of the decay. After applying the same, your dentist will check out whether the decay has been removed completely or not.  
            <br>
            If the decay is completely removed thereafter the dentist will create space for filling where the dentist will clear the debris and cavity of bacteria. In case the decay has reached up to the root region, then your dentist will put in a liner which will be made up of composite resin or other material. This will protect the nerve. 
            <br>
            After cleaning and removing the decay the dentist will use the tooth-colored material and will apply them in layers.  A special light is used for curing or hardening each layer. After completing the layering process, the dentist will shape the composite material & if necessary the dentist will trim off excessive one. 
            The dentist will after this will go for polishing.
            Tooth-Colored Filling Advantages:
            <br>
            a) <b>Aesthetic -</b> The color and shades of this filling are almost close to the teeth.  These are perfectly suited for the front teeth as well as visible parts of teeth.
            <br>
            b) <b>Provides Strong Bonding to Tooth Structure -</b> These fillings are well-known due to their outstanding tooth structure & provide better support to the tooth.
            <br>
            c) <b>Versatile -</b> In addition to filling cavities, these are best fit for repairing chipped, broken, or worn teeth.
            <br>
            d) <b>Prevent Infection -</b> Tooth color filling is excellent in terms of preventing infections, and allows nerves to relax.
