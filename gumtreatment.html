            <h3>gum treatment</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                1) Good oral hygiene and health always offer good results in terms of overall health. Healthy gums are quite important as they provide strength to teeth. Therefore, it’s good to keep gums in good health. For this good oral health, a routine is required. It’s also important to note that gum disease is generally caused by plaque bacteria which are found around, and in between teeth. Special care is always needed for removing these bacteria, and for this brushing and flossing can do wonders.
                <br>
                2)The presence of these bacteria may lead to red, swollen and bleeding gums, finally loss of tooth. Oral care products, mouthwash, brush, and floss can do wonders but if all this doesn’t work we at Krishna Aesthetic Center is an excellent one. At Krishna Aesthetic Center, we offer Pyorrhea treatment & oral care to our patients. We have established ourselves as one of the leading clinics because of our powerful gum disease treatment  by using advanced dental practices including – laser gum treatment , flap surgery, bone grafts, and soft tissue grafts.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>SYMPTOMS OF GUM DISEASE</b>
                <br>
                Gum diseases begin with certain symptoms which we shouldn’t ignore.
                <br>
                a)Red or swollen gums.
                <br>
                b)Constant bad breath.
                <br>
                c)Bleeding gums.
                <br>
                d)Loose teeth.
                <br>
                e)Painful chewing.
                <br>
                f)Sensitive teeth.
                <br>
                <br>
                1. <b>Gingivitis</b>
                <br>
                In Gingivitis disease, the gums become red, swollen and bleed, where this mainly occurs due to inadequate oral hygiene. We find that this cause little or no discomfort at an early stage and can be reversed by taking proper treatment and oral home care. We at Krishna Aesthetic Center  take care of your teeth and do the professional cleaning – scaling and polishing.
                <br>
                2. <b>Periodontitis</b>
                <br>
                Gum disease can reach up to the level of pyorrhoea where bacteria in the plaque region may cause the production of toxins. These toxins can irritate the gums, tissues, as well as bones which basically support the teeth. This tooth gets broken down and destroyed. Gum Disease Treatment At Krishna Aesthetic Center  Premises We use different types of practices for treating gum diseases. Flap surgery/pocket reduction & bone graft are one of the most popular one. Meanwhile, we use deep cleaning (Scaling, curettage, and root planing).
                <br>
                3. <b>Flap Surgery / Pocket Reduction Surgery</b>
                <br>
                This one of the most effective ways to treat gum disease. In this procedure, gums are lifted back and plaque is removed. It works better for smoothening of damaged bone & to restrict the area disease-causing bacteria. The gums are placed well-positioned.
                <br>
                Flap surgery is very beneficial in the space reduction between tooth and gum resulting in no chance of bacterial growth. Therefore, the best fit for diminishing the gum health problems which are linked with periodontal disease. Flap surgery cost  is high but we offer it at the most affordable price.
                <br>
                4. <b>Bone Grafts</b>
                <br>
                 This procedure is very effective in the treatment of destroyed bone caused by gum disease. The bone graft procedure is the best for the regrowth of bone and helps in restoring the teeth’s stability.
                <br>
                5. <b>Soft Tissue Grafts</b> 
                <br>
                It’s a very simple surgical procedure. In the case of receding gum, soft tissue graft is result-oriented. To perform this procedure, tissues are taken from the nearby healthy gum or from the roof of the mouth. After this, these are placed in the affected area.
                6. <b>Bone Surgery</b>
                <br>
                 This procedure is considered best for shallow craters formed due to bone loss. Bone reshaping is done to decrease the craters, which stops the bacterial growth to a greater degree.
                <br>
