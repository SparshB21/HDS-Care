                <b>What is PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) Therapy ?</b>
                <br>
                PRP (Platelet-rich plasma) therapy is one of the most used clinical approaches for hair loss among the hair loss treatments. PRP hair treatment is non-surgical & the best solution for hair restoration. It uses the growth factors in your blood to work for you .
                <br>
                >> It’s a three step medical treatment where a person’s blood is taken out and separated into three layers- platelet poor plasma, platelet-rich plasma and red blood cells. PRP injections after injecting into the scalp can stimulate the natural growth of hair by increasing the blood flow into the hair follicle and providing them the nutrition required for their optimum growth In addition, PRP therapy is best for hair thickness & is completely safe. It’s one of the most effective ways for preventing the hair loss problem and allows faster hair growth.
                <br>
                >> Effect of PRP can be enhanced by using Growth Factors along with it. The use totally depends on your hair condition and it is a decision that your doctor must take for you.

                <b>Prevent Hair Fall from Roots – Causes of Hair Loss</b>
                <br>
                Emotional or physical shock or trauma may cause hair fall. In addition to this other factors can play a significant role in loosen and fall off. Being aware of these problems helps us a lot to eradicate the problem from its root. In this section, we will throw light on a few factors of hair loss.
                <br>
                1) <b>Genetics:</b> Hereditary hair loss is one of the most common reasons in Men and Women’s hair fall. A large group of people are being affected by this, where it gets worse with progressive age. If your parents or relative experience the hair loss problem then you may also have a hair fall problem. Mainly it impacts the scalp region, but in some cases it can occur at any part of the body.
                <br>
                2) <b>Unhealthy Diet:</b> It’s also observed that a poor diet may result in hair fall. Nutrition is needed for better growth & strength of the hair. In absence of proper nutrition damage can be caused to healthy hair. Inefficient diets can inhibit our body to build hair follicles. Therefore it’s advisable to take nutrient rich foods which have an appropriate amount of the minerals, vitamins and micronutrients. In order to get stronger hair, it’s advisable to take nuts, carrots, dark leaf vegetables, eggs, milk and other dairy products.Keep your iron, protein levels high.
                <br>
                3) <b>Environmental Factors / Pollutants:</b> People often experience dandruff, scalp itching, oily scalp, and hair fall problems due to the pollutants present in the atmosphere. Researchers revealed pollutants can show major impact over four major proteins which are known for growth & hair retention. In addition, people may have sensitive scalp syndrome due to the dust, smoke, lead, arsenic, particulate matter & other pollutants.
                4) <b>Stress / Emotional Imbalance:</b> In present times , stress has become a part of our lives to a great degree. These stresses can cause emotional imbalance in your life. Here it’s important to note that hair fall is also associated with stress. You may have hair shedding in a larger amount during stressful periods.
                <br>
                5) <b>Hormonal Imbalance:</b> Now it’s important to note that hair loss problems can occur by the thyroid hormones, pregnancy diseases, and medications. Hormonal imbalance is one of the big reasons, which influences hair growth drastically. Both men and women suffer from hormonal imbalance. DTH, a derivative of testosterone is the main cause of hair follicle among men. In males it causes pattern baldness, and in women it’s inherited alopecia.
                <br>
                6) <b>Weight Loss:</b> Dramatic loss in body’s weight can cause hair loss. There are many factors which play a significant role in the reduction of weight loss suddenly including – unhealthy diet, disease, hormonal changes.
