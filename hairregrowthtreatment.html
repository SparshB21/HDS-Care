                Tackle the Causes of Hair Fall – A Brief Summary
                In this age and date, hair fall is impacting men and women by different means. Excessive hair shedding & continuous thinning is one of the biggest challenges. Different factors influence the hair fall to a great extent. Let’s try to understand the possible reasons for hair loss.
                <br>
                1) <b>Hormonal changes -</b> At any point of age, hormonal changes may cause hair loss. Both men and women can have hormonal imbalances through different reasons such as taking or consuming birth control pills and menstrual pause.
                <br>
                2) <b>Anemia  -</b> It’s also another big reason for hair fall in women, where the loss of essential components such as Deficiency of iron may lead to hair loss. Taking supplements can reduce impacts efficiently.
                <br>
                3) <b>Weight Loss -</b> Excessive or progressive weight loss can speed up hair loss. This may cause a deficiency of important minerals and vitamins. We avoid eating nutrient-rich foods which may further lead to hair loss.
                <br>
                4) <b>Stress -</b> In a day-to-day lifestyle, we are passing through different kinds of stressful situations, which influence our brain & psychology. This stress can increase the hair fall process to a greater extent.
                <br>
                5) <b>Heredity -</b> In addition to the above-mentioned methods, Heredity is another big factor that decides our hair fall problems. We inherit certain traits & diseases from our genes. And at a point in time, we can have hair fall problems.
                <br>
                6) <b>Pollution / Environmental Factors -</b> We can’t deny the fact that we are living in a polluted environment. The increasing pollution is affecting our bodies & hair too much. Air pollution & groundwater pollution will damage the hair.
                <br>
