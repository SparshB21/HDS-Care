                <b>What are WARTS, MOLES & SKIN TAGS?</b>
                <br>
                A wart is contiguous and caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts can be found at any part of the body such as fingers, knees, hands, and elbows. People may come in contact with viruses through different ways including – skin-to-skin contact with someone, or by direct or indirect contact. People may have different types of wart that entirely depends on the HPV type. There are four major types of warts including – common wart, plantar wart, flat warts, and genital warts.
                <br>
                1) <b>Common Warts –</b> This type of wart usually appears on the fingers mostly around the nails. These warts appear like black dots or seeds. These are also known as the “seed warts”.
                <br>
                2) <b>Plantar Warts -</b> Sole of feet is the place where plantar warts grow quickly. If this occurs, people experience pain and irritation in their respective areas.
                <br>
                3) <b>Flat Warts -</b> Impact of these warts can occur anywhere on the skin but mostly seen on the face. Shaving is the most common reason for flat wart.
                <br>
                4) <b>Genital Warts -</b> These warts basically appear near the genital region.
                If these warts are not treated well on time then these could be more expensive & problematic. So special attention should be taken.
