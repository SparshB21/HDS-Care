            <h3>Skin Brightening</h3>
            <p>
                We may experience dull skin as a result of Ageing. As skin matures, the cell regeneration process slows down, consequently dead cell building begins on the skin’s surface. With the passage of time, these cells accumulate & cause less radiant skin. If you’re not happy with your skin tone & appearance then we are here for you. Krishna Aesthetic Center is the foremost skin lightening clinic offering you an array of services including skin whitening & brightening treatment. Our team of professionals listen carefully & use best practices to brighten skin and boost its glow.

                <b>What is SKIN WHITENING ?</b>
                <br>
                Skin Whitening is a very simple way is the practice of using chemical treatment in order to lighten the skin by lowering down the concentration of melanin. Melanin is responsible for skin’s color. Production of this pigment occurs due to melanocytes that are located along the dermal-epidermal junction. Today, skin whitening treatment has been prevalent in our society. To achieve fairness & remove dullness, Krishna Aesthetic Center skin care specialists use chemical substances that are safe for your skin.
