            <h3>Skin Tightening</h3>
            <p>
                1) Loose skin can be frustrating which definitely produces an impact on self-esteem.
                <br>
                2) With age, you can develop loose skin which results in droopiness, wrinkles, and bands.
                <br>
                3) There are different factors that can lead to loose skin – such as aging, sun exposure, weight loss, pregnancy and smoking.
                <br>
                4) Krishna Aesthetic Center is one of the finest clinics which is known for its surgical and non-surgical procedures for skin tightening & other skincare problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Causes of Skin Loose Aging</b>
                <br>
                1) Among the list of skin causes, aging is the best one where the body produces a little amount of collagen as well as elastin in the skin.
                <br>
                2) Elastin fibers play a significant role in making the facial expressions as well as skin’s “bounce back”.
                <br>
                3) In addition to this, Collagen is also vital for the formation of protein which is the best fit for the formation of the skin’s structure.
                <br>
                4) Now it’s important to note that with the passage of time at an older age there is always an impact over normal stretching and contraction. The skin would not be able to bounce back on its own.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Sun Exposure</b>
                <br>
                1) It’s also worth noting that sun exposure can also influence the production of collagen as well as elasticity.
                <br>
                2) It’s also worth noting that the sun damage can do changes in the skin’s DNA and has greater potential for mutating the same.
                <br>
                3) And it can lead to premature cellular death and can break down collagen and elastin.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Weight Loss</b>
                <br>
                1) Weight loss is another BIG reason for skin loss.
                <br>
                2) Bariatric surgery or pregnancy are the two important reasons for weight loss where it can lead to a decrease in volume.
                <br>
                3) It can cause the thinning of the fatty layer. The quick loss of volume impacts the recovery rate. In this journey, you give less time to recover.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Smoking</b>
                <br>
                1) Smoking is also a cause of premature aging, where nicotine causes the narrowing of blood vessels in the outermost layers of your skin.
                <br>
                2) Narrow blood vessels can restrict the blood flow in your skin which further can restrict the supply of oxygen and vital nutrients in your skin.
                <br>
                3) The deficiency of the nutrients can lead to cell death and like sun exposure it can reduce collagen production and elastin.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>SUN EXPOSURE</b>
                <br>
                <b>Non-surgical Skin Tightening Procedures</b>
                <br>
                1) At Krishna Aesthetic Center, we are known for non-surgical skin-tightening procedures for restoring youthful appearance which is caused by aging or weight.
                <br>
                2) We use different procedures including – radiofrequency, HIFU, dermal fillers, and botox for aged and tired skin.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>RF Skin Tightening</b>
                <br>
                1) We offer the RF skin tightening treatment which is the most non-invasive anti-aging treatment.
                <br>
                2) In this treatment, radiofrequency energy is applied to the skin’s face.
                <br>
                3) The measurable electrical currents reshape the skin’s collagen and tighten the skin’s surface.
                <br>
                4) RF waves have the ability to boost the strength of collagen within the skin.
                <br>
                5) It’s good to know that several sessions are needed to make changes visible.
                <br>
                6) In case you experience any kind of heating sensation after the treatment then you can apply a cooling mist or thin gel to get relief from the sensation.
                <br>
                7) Moreover, you should not use any other cosmetic products or lotion which are generally oil-based on the day of the RF skin tightening procedure.
                <br>
                8) During this procedure, we apply the numbing cream to reduce the discomfort.
                <br>
                9) In this treatment procedure, skincare specialists use gliding gel for effectiveness as well as for reducing the irritation.
                <br>
                10) In thermage, radiofrequency energy is used to tighten the lax skin where it’s quite effective for improving the skin’s elasticity and helpful for the production of collagen. This approach is considered good for the abdomen, back of the arms, hands and knees.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)</b>
                <br>
                1) This technique is effective to rejuvenate and tighten the skin, moreover, it’s perfect for stimulating the production of collagen in the skin.
                <br>

                <br>
                3) It can restore the ultrasonic energy and is useful for stimulating the regeneration and restoration of collage.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Dermal Fillers</b>
                <br>
                1) Dermal fillers is the best approach for rejuvenating the skin without aggressive surgical procedures.
